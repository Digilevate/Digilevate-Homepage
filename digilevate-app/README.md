# Digilevate React Project

This project was created with Vite and React.

## How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) must be installed on your machine.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Open your terminal in the project's root folder and run the following command to install all the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Development Server

Once the installation is complete, run this command to start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:5173` where you will see the running application. The server will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.
